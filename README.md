# Brain Information Flow under a Sensorimotor Task

This project was part of the Neuromatch Academy Computational Neuroscience Summer School 2023

## Dataset
For this project the **Steinmetz dataset** was used. This particular dataset contains spike trains from more than 30000 neurons in 42 different brain regions of 10 previously trained mice which are performing a grating stimulus task. For more information about the dataset you can read the Nature [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1787-x)
and watch the [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXn4-FpVaOo).
